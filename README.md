Lessons Learned from this assignment:
- I had time management issues with this project. I finished the Responsive Portfolio but did not have enough time prior to the assignment submission deadline to submit this part of the project. 
-If I had to do this project over again, I would have asked for help from the teacher and TA's much earlier in the process, and started this assignment right after the previous assignment had concluded, so I would have had enough time to complete it.
